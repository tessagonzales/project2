    <h3>Cabo 3/10/08</h3>
    <p>In the process of enjoying my vacation. I'm currently singing 'Despacito' wrong but these mexican lady bartenders love it! They keep laughing and telling me that my friends ditched me. They didn't ditch me, they said they had to go to the bathroom. All five of them. At the same time. Boy, they're really synced. Like females and their periods. Be back on later ladies and gents, I spilled my jalapeno margarita all over my favorite green shirt.</p>

    <h3>First Class 3/7/08 (2)</h3>
    <p>First class was... legendary. I must've had like three champagne glasses and two sour whiskeys. Wow, I was definitely feeling lightheaded. Pretty sure everyone else had a good time. The number I drunkly gave to my flight attendant ended up in the trash. Huh, she must have dropped it. So I gave her my number again. And another written sheet of paper with it just in case. I also let her know that if she gets tired of working she can put her head on my shoulder. I said "shoulder" with air quotes very slowly. She looked confused but I think she got it.  I will ask her if she wants to go get mocha fraps with me when she calls. I don't see why she wouldn't call. After that, I hadn't seen her. She's working back in economy and we have a different first class attendant. An older man. Weird, they must have traded because economy looks harder and maybe the male attendant got lazy? Whatever, I ended up falling asleep watching Vampire Diaries on my tablet. I can't believe Elena gave Damon another chance. Obviously Stephan is the better choice! These vampires give me such a headache! I asked my 13 year old cousin why and she just gave me some crap about me being 30 and watching it. Whatever Sarah! Go play with your dollies!</p>

    <h3>Meeting at the Airport 3/7/08 (1)</h3>
    <p>6am! What a time to be awake! I woke up with drool all over my pillow. That's normal. Sometimes I wake up and I have a pool of saliva that's just waiting for me to choke on. I really hate how my body goes against me sometimes. It's like my mind goes to battle with my body everyday. It's like <i>Are you tired? No. Yes you are. No I'm not. Ok well, I'm going to shut down your motor functions, have fun trying to talk your way out of this one!</i> (After my body shuts down at the bar after having 7 shots.) <i>I'm still not tired.</i> The funny part is, my body usually wins. I lose my motor functions and end up going to sleep. Anyways, let's get back on track. It's 6am, I'm up and I'm ready to start the day. With coffee. Just kidding, mocha frappuccino coming right up. I headed to the airport shortly after and check in. All I need is my backpack full of green shirts and my camera. See, I am simple. In my head I'm not. You can tell, you're reading my thoughts as I type them down. I feel vulnerable now. I met up with the other guys at the gate and as I walk towards them, they all have black coffee. That sucks, my mocha frappachino is too good. I imagine them salivating at the sight of my icy drink. I introduced myself to them, and gave Ryan a big hug <i>"It's ok I forgive you."</i> I say. He looked at me puzzled. Whatver, it will hit him later. His friends look like a bunch of frat guys on vacation from their ex-cheerleader wives. Turns out, I was right. Their wives have been cheerleaders as kids. </p>

    <h3>Packing up 3/6/08</h3>
    <p>As I'm packing, I'm trying to figure out if I should bring my green shirt or my red shirt? I feel like green brings out my eyes, but red pops out more as someone could pick me out in the crowd. I mean, what if I get lost? Then if Ryan (pencil-throwing meathead) has to give a description of me. He could just be like, <i>well, he's wearing red, he'll stick out like a sore thumb</i>. In my head that makes sense. So I will pack a week's worth of red shirts. Thinking about Ryan gives me scary flashbacks of his horrible wedgies. And his pencils that he used to throw at me. He would sharpen them and try to attack my legs so he wouldn't be seen by Ms. Frens. I remember that one time he threw so hard that it drew blood. <i>Blood! I didn't think of that!</i> Blood is red, and if for some godforsaken reason I start bleeding my shirt will cover it. And it won't look like I was hurt. <i>Nevermind, forget it. I'll pack the green shirts instead.</i> I would rather avoid it.

    <h3>The Camera 3/4/08</h3>
    <p>I have an old camera that I decided to take with me to Mexico. Yes, you hear me. I am going to Mexico. Well, I'm going to Cabo. That is a mexican city but it is definitely americanized. Should I feel threatened by the foreignity of it? Guess I'll have to do some more research on the area. Anyways, it'll be spring break and I'm going with five friends. Woo! Technically, they're mutual friends. The one friend I know, (well actually, aquaintance) I met in high school. He used to throw pencils at me. We're over that now. So he's good company. I mean we hung out like twice over the years and he happen to have a friend with the same name and birthdate as me who couldn't go to Cabo anymore. Then he invited me out to not waste the ticket. Imagine my surprise when I heard from him after all this time. The conversation went something like, <i>"Hey! Remember me? I used to throw pencils at you, and give you wedgies? Yeah, well do you want to come to Cabo? Sorry."</i> I appreciate that this is his ticket to my forgiveness. Ha! Get it? "ticket to my forgiveness". Literally a plane ticket. Did I mention that I'm first class? Oh my gosh, I have never been and I am so excited. Wait till I write it on my blog! Crap, I've actually lost track of time, so I bought a camera. And I'm taking that with me to Cabo. Peace out.  </p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Do you know the feeling when you get a piece of gum stuck on your shoe? If you ignore the inital stickiness and the infuriating sound of <i>pop</i>, you'll get used to it. By then the gum has lost it's adhesiveness and it becomes a sore memory. That's me. I'm the annoying person that everyone forgets. That's ok, I prefer it that way. Most people forget my name, but usually it starts of with, <i>"Do you remember that one really annoying guy that we went to school with?" No, not anymore.</i> Ha! Glad I can laugh about it. My therapist says I shouldn't take everything as funny when it hurts, but whatever what does she know? Any-hoo, just going to drop some knowledge... On my blog. Unless you read this after, then maybe you're a little smarter. Or entertained. Ok, I'm being annoying. Forget about me when you exit. Bye. </p><hr>
